Please find solution developed for Rippl

I have included the SQL tables i created via Docker DB.
I find building Database via SSMS/Azure Data Studio is more appropriate than building within application. 

I have build the solution utilizing Entity Framework.
I present a version of 3 tier architecture, I do admit its not text book but hopefully shows the seperation of Presentation/BusinessObjects/DataLayer.

I did attempt to show a mixture of methods of searching and tackling problems.
The overall solution is High Level where the specifics on the External Provider API calls are performed ahve been simplified.
One of those scenarios where further discussion within a scenario would yield refined PoC solution.

Appreciate you reviewing the code and always happy to have pointers/advice appended to further grow!
